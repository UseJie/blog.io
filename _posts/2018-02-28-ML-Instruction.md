## 机器学习
  模仿人类大脑的算法。
  机器自己学习
  机器学习的发展归因于网络和自动化技术的快速发展

## Machine Learning definition:

1. Arthur Samud(1959),Machine Learning Field of study that gives computers the ability to learn whitout being explicithy programmed.

2. Tom Mitchell(1998) Well-posed Learning Problem: A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience "E".

## Machine Learning algorithms:
  - Supervised learning 监督学习
  - Unsupervised learning 非（无）监督学习
  这是最常用的两大类

  - Others: Reinforcenment learning, recommender system.

### Supervised Learning:
 1. 分类问题
 2. 回归问题
 意指要预测一个连续值的输出

### Unspervised Learning:
  1. 聚类算法(离散值)
  没有给出非监督学习的算法一个正确的答案。

### Model Representation:
  Supervised learning: Given the "rigth answer" for each example in the data.
### Regression Problem:
  Predict real-valued output.

### Notation:
    m = Number of traning examples.

    x's = "input" variable/features.
    
    y,s = "output" Variable/"target" variable.
    
    (x,y) --- one traning example.
    
    (x^(i),y^(i)) --- i^th traning example.
